His work has spanned professional sports, collegiate athletics, and national organizations, including the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee, the Chicago Bears, the Washington Redskins, and the Boston Bruins.

# About the Sports Analytics Series

The Sports Analytics Series explores how data reveals structure, change, and decision-making in sports over time. Rather than focusing on advanced models or esoteric metrics, the series emphasizes fundamentals: asking good questions, choosing the right level of aggregation, and using clear visualizations to surface meaningful patterns. Baseball serves as a recurring case study because of its long history and rich data, but the underlying principles apply broadly—to other sports, to business, and to analytics more generally. Each post is designed not just to explain what happened, but to demonstrate how an analyst can discover it.
