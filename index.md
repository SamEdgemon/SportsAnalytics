**Welcome to the Sports Analytics Series** — a learning experience designed to help you think and work like a data scientist, using the world of sports as your training ground.

Across this series, we’ll explore how data shapes the way we understand sports: how games are played, how players evolve, how decisions are made, and how strategies are built.

You’ll learn through a sequence of blog posts that follow a consistent cadence. Together, we will:

- **Discover** the history of each sport by revisiting its innovators, key players, and defining moments

- **Access, query, and extract real sports data**

- **Analyze and visualize** datasets through tables, charts, and comparisons

- **Practice a full analytics workflow** — from raw information to clear, actionable insight

Along the way, you’ll get hands-on experience with tools used every day by analysts and data scientists, including **SAS, SQL, Python, and R**, while working with real datasets and real-world examples.

**Software and data will be provided** — everything you need to learn, practice, and explore.
