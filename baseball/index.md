## Welcome to Sabermetrics 101 v0

If you’ve ever wondered what “analytics” really means — or if this is your first time seeing data science in action — you’ve come to the right place.

In this series, we’ll explore the story of baseball through the lens of data. From the early days of box scores to today’s world of high-speed analytics, baseball has always been a game of numbers — measured, debated, and redefined through statistics. Together, we’ll see how data has described baseball’s past and continues to shape its future.

But this series is about more than just baseball — it’s about learning to think and work like a data scientist. You’ll practice the core skills of a data scientist: accessing and querying data, exploring and analyzing it, visualizing results, and ultimately turning raw data into meaningful insights. Along the way, you’ll gain hands-on experience with some great analytical tools (like SAS, Python, R, and SQL).

**How We’ll Work With the Data**

Each post will follow a consistent cadence. We will

- **Explore** the history of the game through its innovators, players, and key moments
- **Access** data using SQL queries
- **Process, analyze, and visualize** data using SAS
- **Summarize** what we learned and see how it all comes together in SAS


*So grab your glove, open your laptop, and get ready to step up to the plate. 
Let’s play ball!*
